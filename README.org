* Installation

This package is only available through loading the source. To install:

First, either clone this repo or download the ~gcode-mode.el~ file. Make note
of the location of this file.

Now in your emacs config, add something like this:
#+begin_src elisp
  (push "~/repos/gcode-mode" load-path)
  (require 'gcode-mode)
#+end_src

In Spacemacs, this would be in the ~dotspacemacs/user-config~ function.

Now, if you reload emacs, and open a ~.gcode~ file, it should open in gcode mode
and have syntax highlighting.
